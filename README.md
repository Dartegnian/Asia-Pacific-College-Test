# Asia Pacific College Testing Program
Our professor tasked us to develop a program that utilizes radiobuttons as a means of selection. The best program I thought of was a testing program. And thus, this program was created.

This program tests the user on 2 subjects: computer science and English literature. Select the answer that seems the most correct to you and, if you selected the right one, the scoreboard on the top-right will update immediately. If not, then your answer was wrong.
