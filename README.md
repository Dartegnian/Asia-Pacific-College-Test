# Asia Pacific College Testing Program
Our professor tasked us to develop a program that utilizes radiobuttons as a means of selection. The best program I thought of was a testing program. And thus, this program was created. After this, our professor then tasked us to develop a program that uses checkboxes as a means of selection, and my next project can be found here: https://github.com/Dartegnian/HarvardFAS-Calculator

This program tests the user on 2 subjects: computer science and English literature. Select the answer that seems the most correct to you and, if you selected the right one, the scoreboard on the top-right will update immediately. If not, then your answer was wrong.
